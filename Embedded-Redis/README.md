# Embedded Redis in Spring Boot

**Author:** Harshal

This guide explains how to embed Redis within a Spring Boot application for local development and testing purposes.

## Summary

- Add the Spring Boot Starter for Redis to your project's dependencies.

- Configure Redis connection properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

- Create a Redis configuration class to set up the connection.

- Use the `RedisTemplate` to interact with Redis data structures in your application.

- Start your Spring Boot application to use the embedded Redis server for caching and data storage.

- Access the embedded Redis server for testing using a Redis client or `redis-cli`.

Embedding Redis in your Spring Boot application is suitable for development and testing environments.

For production, consider using a standalone Redis server. Customize Redis configuration and usage based on your application's requirements.
