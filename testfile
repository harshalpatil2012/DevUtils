F5 DNS servers have been added to enhance resiliency across our K, S, and B data centers.
Consumers from K, S, and B calling providers will always have a backup site available.
Previously, direct calls to providers were at risk of failing.
Going forward, even during provider releases, K, S, and B consumers will experience no impact due to the fallback site.
In case of any issue, the backup site will be available to ensure continuous service.
