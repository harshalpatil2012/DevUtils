Description:
As a QA Engineer, I want to create a JMeter test plan to measure the performance of the GET API, so that we can ensure the API meets our performance criteria under different load conditions.

Task:
Test Plan Creation:
Create a JMeter test plan to simulate GET API requests.
Configure the test plan to include necessary components (Thread Group, HTTP Request, Listeners).
Ensure the test plan can be easily modified for different environments (e.g., dev, stage).

Load Simulation: 
Simulate various load conditions (e.g., 10, 100, 500 concurrent users).
Define ramp-up periods and loop counts for realistic load testing scenarios.

Assertions:
Add assertions to verify the response code (e.g., 200 OK).
Ensure the response time is within acceptable limits (e.g., < 500 ms).

Result Analysis:
Configure listeners to collect performance metrics (e.g., Response Time, Throughput, Error Rate).
Generate and save test results in a structured format (e.g., CSV, HTML).

Documentation:
Document the test plan setup and execution steps.
Provide guidelines on how to interpret the test results.
Include recommendations for performance improvement based on test outcomes.
