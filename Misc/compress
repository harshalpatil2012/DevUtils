Producer Microservice (Generating JSON Response):Add the spring-boot-starter-tomcat dependency to your pom.xml or build.gradle file.Set the server.compression.enabled property to true in your application.properties or application.yml.Optionally, you can configure compression properties such as server.compression.mime-types and server.compression.min-response-size based on your requirements.Consumer Microservice (Consuming JSON Response):Ensure that the consumer microservice is capable of handling Gzip-encoded responses. Spring Boot typically handles this automatically.No specific changes are needed in the consumer microservice to handle Gzip encoding; Spring Boot should handle it transparently.Test Scenarios:Positive Cases:Verify that the producer microservice compresses JSON responses using Gzip.Ensure the consumer microservice correctly decompresses and processes the received Gzip-encoded JSON responses.Negative Cases:Test the producer microservice with a request that does not support Gzip encoding and confirm it receives an uncompressed response.Send a malformed Gzip-encoded response from the producer and verify the consumer gracefully handles the error.Performance Testing:Measure the response time and payload size with and without Gzip encoding to ensure the benefits of compression.Evaluate the impact on CPU usage for both microservices during high load scenarios.Monitoring and Logging:Implement logging to trace Gzip encoding and decoding processes.Utilize monitoring tools to track compression ratios, response times, and other relevant metrics
