// Alternative Approach 1: Eager Fetching with Entity Graph

/*
   Approach:
   Attempted to use the @EntityGraph annotation to define a fetch plan for eager loading
   of associated entities (versions) in a single query.
*/

@Entity
@Table(name = "OPER")
@Data
public class OperatorDetail {

    @Id
    @Column(name = "OPER ID")
    private String id;

    // ... other fields

    @OneToMany(targetEntity = VersionDetailRecord.class, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "OPER ID", referencedColumnName = "OPER ID")
    private List<VersionDetailRecord> versions = new ArrayList<>();
}

// Issues:
// Entity Graphs often lead to cartesian products, causing performance issues when dealing with large result sets.
// Difficulties in customizing the fetch plan based on specific use cases.
java

// Alternative Approach 2: Custom Fetch Strategy with Hibernate

/*
   Approach:
   Investigated the possibility of implementing a custom fetch strategy with Hibernate
   to optimize the loading of associated entities.
*/

// CustomFetchStrategy implementation (Not a real implementation, just for illustration)

public class CustomFetchStrategy {

    public List<OperatorDetail> fetchOperatorDetailsWithVersions() {
        // Custom logic for fetching OperatorDetails with versions
    }
}

// Issues:
// Custom fetch strategies may add complexity and could potentially lead to maintenance challenges.
// Limited improvements observed in N+1 query scenarios.
java

// Alternative Approach 3: DTO Projection with Spring Data JPA

/*
   Approach:
   Explored the use of DTO projections with Spring Data JPA to fetch only the required fields
   from the database.
*/

public interface OperatorDetailRepository extends JpaRepository<OperatorDetail, String> {

    @Query("SELECT od.id, od.statusIndicator, od.providerName, od.cid, od.ica, od.countryCode, od.statusCodeDescription FROM OperatorDetail od")
    List<Object[]> findOperatorDetails();
}

// Issues:
// Limited control over the loading of associated entities when using DTO projections.
// Difficulty in populating nested DTOs and handling relationships.
java

// Alternative Approach 4: Subquery Optimization

/*
   Approach:
   Attempted to optimize the subquery in the original OperatorDetailRepository query.
*/

public interface OperatorDetailRepository extends JpaRepository<OperatorDetail, String> {

    @Query("SELECT od FROM OperatorDetail od WHERE od.id IN (SELECT DISTINCT od.id FROM OperatorDetail od LEFT JOIN FETCH od.versions ver)")
    List<OperatorDetail> findOperatorDetails();
}

// Issues:
// Subquery optimization might not always be effective, especially in complex queries or with large datasets.
// Difficulties in ensuring consistent performance across different database systems.
