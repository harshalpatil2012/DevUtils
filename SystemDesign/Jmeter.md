| Avg. Response Time (ms) |               |               |     |         | [ +/- %]          |
| 90th Percentile (ms)    |               |               |     |         | [ +/- %]          |
| Error Rate (%)          |               |               |     |         | [ +/- %]          |
| Throughput (Requests/sec) |               |               |     |         | [ +/- %]          |

## Summary of Findings:

* **Pre-Optimization:** [Concisely summarize pre-optimization performance. Were goals met? Were there significant issues?]
* **Post-Optimization:** [Concisely summarize post-optimization performance. Did optimizations improve metrics? Were goals now met?]
* **Bottlenecks Identified:** [List specific areas of the application or infrastructure that caused slowdowns or errors]
* **Recommendations:** [Actionable suggestions based on the test results, e.g., code optimization, hardware upgrades, configuration changes]

## Conclusion:

[Provide a brief overall assessment of the system's performance. Is it ready for production or further testing needed?]
