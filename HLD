Problem Statement:The existing Java service class lacks a method for comparing dates, impacting the functionality that requires date comparisons. A new method needs to be added to address this gap.High-Level Design (HLD):1. Class Overview:Existing Class: DateUtilityServicePurpose: To provide utility methods for handling date-related operations.2. Modification:New Method:public class DateUtilityService {
    // Existing methods...

    /**
     * Compare two dates and return the result.
     *
     * @param date1 The first date to compare.
     * @param date2 The second date to compare.
     * @return 0 if dates are equal, -1 if date1 is before date2, 1 if date1 is after date2.
     */
    public int compareDates(Date date1, Date date2) {
        // Implementation for date comparison
    }
}3. Impact Analysis:The new method adds a valuable capability to the DateUtilityService.The implementation ensures proper comparison handling and supports date-related functionalities.4. Testing:Unit tests should be created to validate the correctness of the new method.Integration tests may be required to ensure the overall functionality of the DateUtilityService is not compromised.Low-Level Design (LLD):1. Class Details:Class Name: DateUtilityServiceLocation: com.example.utils2. New Method:Method Name: compareDatesParameters:date1 (Type: Date) - The first date to compare.date2 (Type: Date) - The second date to compare.Return Type: intDescription: Compares the two input dates and returns:0 if dates are equal,-1 if date1 is before date2,1 if date1 is after date2.3. Implementation:Utilize standard Java date comparison methods to implement the compareDates method.Ensure proper null-checks for input parameters.public class DateUtilityService {
    // Existing methods...

    public int compareDates(Date date1, Date date2) {
        if (date1 == null || date2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Dates cannot be null");
        }

        return date1.compareTo(date2);
    }
}4. Testing:Write unit tests to cover various scenarios, including equal dates, dates in the past, and dates in the future.Consider edge cases, such as null inputs.5. Documentation:Update Javadoc comments for the new method to provide clear usage guidelines.Ensure documentation reflects the changes made to the class.Conclusion:The addition of the compareDates method enhances the functionality of the DateUtilityService class, providing a convenient way to compare dates in various scenarios. This small change ensures improved flexibility and usability within the existing codebase
