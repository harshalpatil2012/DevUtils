Release Branches and Versioning Strategy
===============================================

This document outlines the recommended strategy for managing release branches and versioning for a common web application.

Release Branches:
-----------------

1. Main Branch (Master):
   - Represents the mainline development.
   - All development work and features are initially branched off from 'main.'

2. Feature Branches:
   - Created for new features or enhancements.
   - Naming convention: 'feature/<feature-name>' or 'feature-<feature-name>'.

3. Bugfix Branches:
   - Created to fix issues in the codebase.
   - Naming convention: 'bugfix/<issue-description>' or 'fix-<issue-description>'.

4. Release Branches:
   - Created when preparing for a new version release.
   - Naming convention: 'release/<version-number>' or 'v<version-number>'.

5. Hotfix Branches:
   - Used for critical bug fixes in the current production version.
   - Naming convention: 'hotfix/<issue-description>' or 'fix-<issue-description>'.

Versioning:
-----------

1. Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
   - Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
   - Increment MAJOR for backward-incompatible changes.
   - Increment MINOR for backward-compatible new features.
   - Increment PATCH for backward-compatible bug fixes.

2. Release Candidate (RC) or Beta Versions:
   - Consider creating RC or beta versions for testing.
   - Labeled with '-rc' or '-beta' suffix (e.g., '1.0.0-rc1').

3. Version Tags:
   - Tag each release with a version number (e.g., 'v1.2.3') on the release branch.
   - Ensure tags point to specific commits.

4. Changelogs:
   - Maintain a changelog describing changes in each release.
   - Include in the repository for reference.

5. Versioning in Code:
   - Include the current version number in the codebase (e.g., configuration files).

Release Process:
----------------

1. Feature Development:
   - Develop features or enhancements in feature branches.
   - Conduct code reviews and testing.

2. Bug Fixes:
   - Address and fix bugs in bugfix branches.
   - Verify fixes and testing.

3. Release Preparation:
   - Create a release branch when preparing for a new version.
   - Merge approved features and bug fixes into the release branch.
   - Perform additional testing and validation.

4. Hotfixes (if needed):
   - Address critical issues in production with hotfix branches.

5. Tagging and Deployment:
   - Tag the release branch with the version number.
   - Deploy tagged releases to staging/production.

6. Changelog Update:
   - Update the changelog with release details.

7. Merge to Main:
   - After a successful release, merge release branch changes into 'main.'

8. Repeat:
   - Repeat the process for subsequent versions.

This strategy helps manage and track development and deployment effectively while ensuring clear versioning and documentation.
