Alternative Approaches Explored:
1. Eager Fetching with Entity Graph:
Approach:

Attempted to use the @EntityGraph annotation to define a fetch plan for eager loading of associated entities (versions) in a single query.
Issues:

Entity Graphs often lead to cartesian products, causing performance issues when dealing with large result sets.
Difficulties in customizing the fetch plan based on specific use cases.
2. Custom Fetch Strategy with Hibernate:
Approach:

Investigated the possibility of implementing a custom fetch strategy with Hibernate to optimize the loading of associated entities.
Issues:

Custom fetch strategies may add complexity and could potentially lead to maintenance challenges.
Limited improvements observed in N+1 query scenarios.
3. DTO Projection with Spring Data JPA:
Approach:

Explored the use of DTO projections with Spring Data JPA to fetch only the required fields from the database.
Issues:

Limited control over the loading of associated entities when using DTO projections.
Difficulty in populating nested DTOs and handling relationships.

4. Subquery Optimization:
Approach:

Attempted to optimize the subquery in the original Repository query.
Issues:

Subquery optimization might not always be effective, especially in complex queries or with large datasets.
Difficulties in ensuring consistent performance across different database systems.
