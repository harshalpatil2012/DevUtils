step-by-step example of how to achieve this:

Assuming you have the "mulesoft-labs/raml-java-tools" tool downloaded and set up:

Step 1: Prepare Your RAML File

Create a RAML file that defines your API data types. For example, you can create a file named api.raml:

raml
Copy code
# My API RAML Specification

types:
  Person:
    properties:
      firstName: string
      lastName: string
Step 2: Generate Java POJOs

Using the tool, generate Java POJOs with Lombok annotations based on your RAML specification. Run the following command in your terminal:

shell

java -jar raml-to-pojo.jar -l lombok -p com.example.generated -d src/main/java /path/to/your/api.raml
-l lombok specifies that you want to use Lombok annotations.
-p com.example.generated specifies the package name for the generated POJOs.
-d src/main/java specifies the output directory for the generated Java files.
/path/to/your/api.raml should be replaced with the actual path to your RAML file.
This command will generate Java POJOs in the specified package and output directory with Lombok annotations applied.

Step 3: Include Generated POJOs in Your Project

Include the generated POJOs in your Java project. You will need to make sure that the Lombok library is also included as a dependency in your project.

Step 4: Use Generated POJOs in Your Code

You can now use the generated POJOs with Lombok annotations in your Java code to work with data structures defined in your RAML specification. For example:

java
Copy code
import com.example.generated.Person;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setFirstName("John");
        person.setLastName("Doe");

        System.out.println("First Name: " + person.getFirstName());
        System.out.println("Last Name: " + person.getLastName());
    }
}
Make sure to adapt the package name and paths to match your project's structure and configuration.
