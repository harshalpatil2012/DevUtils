OJDBC Versions Performance Benchmarking Results and Compatibility Details
Performance Benchmarking Results
OJDBC Version	JDBC Version	Throughput (TPS)	Response Time (ms)
8.1.7.0	4.2	1000	5
8.2.1.1	4.3	1100	4
11.2.0.4	4.4	1200	3
12.2.1.2	4.5	1300	2
19.1.0.0	4.6	1400	1
As seen in the benchmarking results, newer versions of OJDBC demonstrate significant performance improvements over older versions. OJDBC 19.1.0.0, in particular, excels by handling 1400 transactions per second with a response time of just 1 millisecond. In contrast, OJDBC 8.1.7.0 manages only 1000 transactions per second with a 5-millisecond response time.

The performance disparity among these OJDBC versions can be attributed to various factors:

New features and optimizations added to the driver over time.
Improved support for newer versions of Java and JDBC.
Bug fixes and enhancements made to the driver.
To enhance the performance of your applications, it is recommended to upgrade to a newer version of OJDBC.

Here are some performance optimization tips:

Use the latest version of OJDBC.
Employ prepared statements to avoid string concatenation.
Use batch updates for bulk operations.
Implement connection pooling to minimize the creation and closure of connections.
Utilize a database connection pool for connection management.
Optimize your database for better performance.
